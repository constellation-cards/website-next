      You can choose to draw a card of this type
      to see if you meet a challenge.

      The card will suggest ways in which the challenge was met.
      You can use one of these, or make up your own.

      If a card indicates that you missed,
      you may not try to meet the challenge in other ways.

      A GM or other facilitator may adjust the ratio
      of hit or miss cards in this stack
      to reflect the difficulty of a given action.
