    desc: >
      Two neighborhoods are connected via criminal activity.
      This could range from petty theft or pickpocketing,
      to smuggling of contraband, to intimidation or murder.
      Not every criminal is disliked; someone who steals from
      the rich to give to the poor will be popular among the poor.

      A stable Criminal dynamic often means organized crime,
      such as a cartel, criminal fraternity, thieves' guild,
      or the like.
    prompts:
      - What kinds of laws exist in the city? Which ones are being broken?
      - Who enforces those laws? Why aren't they doing so here?
      - How does the public view this criminal element, e.g. as heroes or villains?

      An unstable Criminal dynamic might mean gang war
      between rival criminal factions. It might also mean
      a single leader is responsible, and they could be taken
      down via force or guile.

- front: &Commercial

      People from one neighborhood buy or sell
      goods and services to the other.
      Advertising, word of mouth, or tradition might
      entice new visitors.

      A stable Commercial dynamic means there's enough
      to go around, or that the market is adaptable enough
      to come up with something new when tastes change.
    prompts:
      - Who pays whom, and for what?
      - Who benefits from the arrangement? Who suffers?
      - Who would like a piece of the action?

      People from one neighborhood in the dynamic
      buy or sell goods and services to the other.
      It might be hard to find what you're looking
      for, however.

      An unstable Commercial dynamic indicates a market
      in flux, such as prices rapidly changing, too much
      supply, or too little demand. Workers might be in
      short supply, or customers are drying up.
    prompts:
      - Who gains from the instability? Who loses?
      - Where else can supply, demand, or labor be found instead?
      - How are people coping?

      Two neighborhoods interact via power, influence, and leadership.
      One might dominate another, depend on another for legitimacy,
      or prioritize or ignore that neighborhood's needs in particular.

      A stable Political dynamic means a long-standing arrangement
      or an entrenched situation. Enough people, or the right people,
      like things as they are and work to keep it that way.
    prompts:
      - Who benefits from the situation? Who suffers?
      - What keeps the relationship going?
      - How reluctant are people to acknowledge or confront the situation?

      One might dominate another, depend on another for legitimacy,
      or prioritize or ignore that neighborhood's needs in particular.

      An unstable Political dynamic means the power structure is collapsing,
      whether due to internal conflicts or outside agitation.
      Something's going to topple the tower of power,
      but who will be beneath it when it finally falls?
    prompts:
      - Who is agitating for change? Who holds the line?
      - What outside influences are present? Who do they support?
      - Is the struggle physically peaceful or violent?
