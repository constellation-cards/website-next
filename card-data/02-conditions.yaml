      You've been affected by injury, delirium, debts, magical curses, or other problems.

      You can take a condition to get a hit. Describe how. Players who challenge you can suggest conditions to meet it.
      
      The condition is fictionally true and limits your actions.
      If you narrate an action the condition would interfere with,
      you must meet the challenge of the condition in addition to any other challenges.
      
      You can flip a front-side condition to worsen it and get a hit. Describe how.
      
      Clearing conditions takes time. Use this time to drive drama,
      build the world, or explore how you clear the condition.
      
      Discard any conditions that no longer apply in the fiction.
